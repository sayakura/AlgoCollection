 * Problem Statement #
Given a set of positive numbers (non zero) and a target sum ‘S’. Each number should be assigned either a ‘+’ or ‘-’ sign. We need to find out total ways to assign symbols to make the sum of numbers equal to target ‘S’.

Example 1: #
Input: {1, 1, 2, 3}, S=1
Output: 3
Explanation: The given set has '3' ways to make a sum of '1': {+1-1-2+3} & {-1+1-2+3} & {+1+1+2-3}
Example 2: #
Input: {1, 2, 7, 1}, S=9
Output: 2
Explanation: The given set has '2' ways to make a sum of '9': {+1+2+7-1} & {-1+2+7+1}
